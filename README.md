# ðŸ“Š Automated Document Analysis System

## Executive Summary
Our solution is an **automated document analysis system** designed to efficiently extract insights from large volumes of **unstructured text data**. Leveraging **AWS services, Jupyter notebooks, and Tableau**, the system processes documents uploaded to **Amazon S3**, identifies key themes through **hierarchical clustering**, and extracts **causal relationships** to uncover root causes of trends. 

The insights are **visualized in Tableau dashboards**, allowing stakeholders to make **data-driven decisions**.

---

## Visualization Overview
To enhance data interpretability, the system employs the following visualization techniques:

- **Heatmaps:** Visualizes frequency/intensity of keywords over time to detect trends.
- **Knowledge Graphs:** Maps causal relationships between entities.
- **Scatter Plots:** Identifies correlations and outliers in sentiment analysis.
- **Geographical Insights:** Maps global activity and regional influence of key topics.
- **Interactive Dashboards (Tableau):** Enables real-time drill-down analysis.

### Key Trends from Clustering
Using **KMeans clustering with TF-IDF scores**, the system identifies five key themes:
1. **Healthcare & Medical Research Focus** (Cluster 2)
2. **Technology & AI Business Evolution** (Cluster 4)
3. **China International Trade** (Cluster 3)
4. **Singapore Local Development** (Cluster 0)
5. **International Relations & Conflicts** (Cluster 1)

### Sentiment Analysis Insights
- **Singapore Local Development:** Highly polarized sentiment (-0.4 to 0.55), suggesting mixed public perception.
- **International Relations & Conflicts:** Predominantly negative sentiment due to geopolitical tensions.
- **Healthcare & Medical Research:** Balanced sentiment, with optimism around medical advancements.
- **China International Trade:** Mixed sentiment, reflecting both opportunities and concerns in trade.
- **Technology & AI Evolution:** Highest positive sentiment (~0.6), indicating strong enthusiasm for AI.

### Geographical Insights
- **Singapore Local Development:** High mention count from **USA (528 mentions)** and **China (79 mentions)**, indicating strong international attention.
- **International Relations & Conflicts:** Western nations dominate mentions (**USA, Russia, UK**), highlighting global power dynamics.
- **Healthcare & Medical Research:** Primarily covered in **USA (152 mentions)**, reinforcing its role in global research.
- **China International Trade:** Singapore is a key **trade bridge** between China and emerging Southeast Asian markets.
